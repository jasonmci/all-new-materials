Minimum Marketing Feature
* linting
- continuous integration
- gauge


User Stories:
- linting
- unit testing custom code


Engineering Tasks:
- Create a very simple http server
  - Use a framework like express. 
  - Update script to enforce version of node. 
  - The test is not stopping; fix the test


Subtasks:
- install jake
- configure the default task
- install a docker container that is the same as circle ci. 
    - docker pull circleci/node 
    - although we can use circle ci to build, there is a lot to learn from the
      rigorous approach
- assure we cannot merge to master until those tests pass. 
- how can we run tests on the branch prior to pulling. 

Chapter 5
- how to guarantee a good integration build
- modified to use circle ci to verify automatically
  instead of going to another box, circleci is the other box
