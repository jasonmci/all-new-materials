All New Materials

To build:
- Install Node.js 8.9.4
- Install Git
- Clone Repo
- Run jake

Continous integration
- Circle CI runs tests

User Stories:
 - Enforce the node version

Engineering Tasks:
* Create a very simple HTTP server

TODO on the Current Task:
  - Modify build script to enforce Node version
  - integrate
  - when do we deliver continuously, or can i add that in?

Future Ideas:
- Create Fail Fast assertion code.
  - Simian Army
  - Chaos Monkey

Subtasks:
- install a docker container that is the same as circle ci. 
    - docker pull circleci/node 
    - although we can use circle ci to build, there is a lot to learn from the
      rigorous approach
- assure we cannot merge to master until those tests pass. 
- how can we run tests on the branch prior to pulling. 

Chapter 5
- how to guarantee a good integration build
- modified to use circle ci to verify automatically
  instead of going to another box, circleci is the other box
